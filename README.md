# Social-Media
I crafted a vibrant social media front-end website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a focus on user experience, the responsive design ensures seamless navigation. JavaScript brings interactivity, enabling features like real-time updates and user engagement. The result is a visually appealing platform for connecting and sharing experiences.
